#### [Project Info]() | [Demo](https://c5b0-2600-6c44-74f0-94d0-d488-6c6e-3fdd-db05.ngrok-free.app/) | 12/2024

- Built a scalable search engine similar to Google or Bing.
- Includes information retrieval concepts like text analysis (tf-idf) and link analysis (PageRank), and parallel data processing with MapReduce.
- Uses a Service-Oriented Architecture to scale dynamic pages and web search.
- Creates a segmented inverted index of web pages using a pipeline of MapReduce programs.
- Built an Index server, a REST API app that returns search results in JSON format.
- Built a Search server, a user interface that returns search results just like Google or Bing.
    
Technologies: Python, SQL, Flask, HTML and CSS, JSON</p>

## Performance Predictions in TB and HIV  
#### [Report](https://reevafaisal.github.io/Performance-Predictions-in-TB-HIV/index.html) | 11/2024 
- This project leverages logistic regression to measure the predictive performance of Case Detection Rate (CDR) in country-specific mortality outcomes for patients with a dual burden of Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV). 
- Using data from the Tuberculosis Burden by Country dataset, it evaluates the role of CDR in determining mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs).
- Feature engineering techniques such as logarithmic scaling and quantile transformation were applied to the baseline model to address data skewness and improve model performance.
- The final model demonstrated an improvement in AUC for dual-burden mortality predictions, emphasizing the importance of early case detection in mitigating public health challenges.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn </p>
